#' ## Data source
#' 
#' We’re using data from the
#' [Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org/),
#' a standardised and curated collection of mortality data from countries
#' around the world. For this analysis we’ll concentrate on the World Bank’s
#' ‘high-income countries’ in that database, averaged over the five most recent
#' years of data.

#' ## Results
#' 
#' Assuming the graph looks OK, you’ve done it! And we can now calculate a few
#' numbers describing the data…
#' 
#+ numerical_results

# Mortality rate doubling time
log_fit_mortality <-
  lm(
    log2(risk) ~ age, # log2 because we want doubling time
    # Only use data for 30 to 89 year-olds
    data = avg_lt %>% filter(age >= 30 & age <= 90)
  )
mrdt <- 1/coef(log_fit_mortality)[2]

# Cumulative odds of making certain ages
avg_lt <-
  avg_lt %>%
  mutate(odds_cum = c(1, head(cumprod(1-risk), -1)))

# Safest ages
min_risk <- avg_lt %>% top_n(-3, risk) %>% arrange(-desc(risk))

# Age when risk of death exceeds that of the first year of life
age_risk_0 <- min(avg_lt$age[avg_lt$risk > avg_lt$risk[avg_lt$age == 0]])

# Age when risk of death exceeds 1%
age_risk_1pc <- min(avg_lt$age[avg_lt$risk > 0.01])

# Age when risk of death exceeds 1/6
age_risk_dice <- min(avg_lt$age[avg_lt$risk > 1/6])

#' * The mortality rate doubling time, the amount of time it takes for risk of
#'   death to double, is `r pretty_number(mrdt)` years.
#' * The safest age to be is `r min_risk$age[1]` years old. The chance of you
#'   not making your `r min_risk$age[1]+1`th birthday is
#'   `r pretty_number(min_risk$risk[1], percentage = TRUE)`, or 1 in
#'   `r pretty_number(1/min_risk$risk[1])`
#' * The next safest ages are `r min_risk$age[2]` and `r min_risk$age[3]`,
#'   with odds of death in that year of
#'   `r pretty_number(min_risk$risk[2], percentage = TRUE)` and
#'   `r pretty_number(min_risk$risk[3], percentage = TRUE)`.
#' * An 80-year-old is
#'   `r pretty_number(avg_lt$risk[avg_lt$age == 80]/avg_lt$risk[avg_lt$age == 30])`
#'   times more likely to die than a 30-year-old.
#' * Your risk of death doesn’t exceed your risk in the first year of life until
#'   you’re `r pretty_number(age_risk_0)` years old.
#' * Your risk of death exceeds 1% when you’re `r pretty_number(age_risk_1pc)`
#'   years old.
#' * Your risk of death aged `r pretty_number(age_risk_dice)` is 1 in 
#'   `r pretty_number(1/avg_lt$risk[avg_lt$age == age_risk_dice])`, worse than a
#'   dice roll.
#' 
#' Finally, here are some odds of death at various ages:
